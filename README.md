# **Company Bankrupcy Prediction (Using Decision Tree)**

## **Problem Statement :**
The goal of this project is to **predict whether a company is likely to go bankrupt, using a Decision Tree** classification model

Bankruptcy prediction is crucial for:

1.   Investors and creditors assessing financial risk
2.   Early warning systems for companies
3. Supporting data-driven financial decisions

## **Dataset Information**

**Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository – Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction Dataset

**Years Covered:** 1999–2009

**Instances:** 6,819 companies

**Features:** 95 financial ratios (X1–X95)

**Target:** Y = 1 → bankrupt, Y = 0 → not bankrupt

The dataset includes key financial ratios such as ROA, operating profit, debt ratios, cash flow, equity ratios, current ratio, and more.

## **Objective**

Develop a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn to classify companies as bankrupt or not, including:

1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature Reduction using PCA
3. Decision Tree training
4. Evaluation with 5 - cross-validation
5. Comparision Before Tuning and After Tuning
